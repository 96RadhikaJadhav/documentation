# Documentation for Rucio

This is the main branch for Rucio's documentation. 

Currently hosted on GH-pages & using Docusaurus, the website for Rucio's documentation aims to:


- Rid the Sphinx dependency by directly introducing RST -> Markdown Conversion for non-API related documentation
- Introduce MDX support (in v2)
- Introduce translation support
