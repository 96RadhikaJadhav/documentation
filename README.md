# Documentation for Rucio

Welcome!

There are 3 branches in this repository:

- sphinx: Containing the build files for API-related documentation
- master: Containing the build files for Docusaurus
- gh-pages: Hosting the website

The current solution for Rucio's documentation aims to:

- Rid the Sphinx dependency by directly introducing RST -> Markdown Conversion for non-API related documentation
- Introduce MDX support (in v2)
- Introduce translation support

Should you wish to make any change to this repository, please read through the [Contributing Guide](http://rucio.cern.ch/documentation/docs/Contributing)
