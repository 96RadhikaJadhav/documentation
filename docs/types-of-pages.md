In the ``rucio/documentation`` repository, we have different types
of pages based on the source of the documentation.

Our [API Documentation](/rucio-doc/rucio/index.html) is generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) & therefore,
lives in the [source code](). Should there be any changes to the
APIs listed [here](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/tree/master/lib/rucio/web/rest/flaskapi/v1) & [here](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/tree/master/lib/rucio/client), an entire rebuild of the RST files will be carried out to reflect 
the new content. This will be triggered automatically via Github Actions
once your pull request for modification is approved.

All the other documentation on this website is built using
[Docusaurus]() and is written in Markdown. It lives in the
``docs`` folder under the ``rucio/documentation`` GitHub repository.
