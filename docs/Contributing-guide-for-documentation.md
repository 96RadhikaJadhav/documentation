*Rucio welcomes improvements from all contributors, new & experienced*

## Getting started

Everyone is welcome to open an issue about documentation or contribute a 
change with a pull request (PR) to the ``rucio/documentation`` GitHub 
repository. You need to be comfortable with git & GitHub to effectively 
make contributions in the Rucio community.

Start getting involved with the Rucio documentation in three easy steps:

- Familiarize yourself with the [static site generator](https://docusaurus.io/) & the [API documentation generator](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).
- Fork a local copy of the Rucio documentation repository.
- Ensure you understand the basics of opening a pull request & submitting an issue.

## Making your first contribution!

- Understand the different [types of pages](page-types)
- If you're suggesting improvements, head over to the [Contributing Improvements](contributing-improvements) 
section. 
- For contributing new content, read through the [New Content Contribution Guide](new-content-contribution-guide)
to know more.
- Check ``rucio/documentation`` repository for issues labelled "good first issues".
